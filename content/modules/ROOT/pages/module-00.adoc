= Section 2 - Log Enrichment and Prompt Generation Workflow

== Objective

In this section, we will build the first workflow called the **AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generationn** workflow. This workflow will be triggered by Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) whenever an issue is detected in the system. Specifically, this demo is set up to respond to an Apache (httpd) service failure.

This workflow will check the status of the Apache service, notify a Mattermost channel with details, ask RHEL AI to analyze the incident, and finally create a new job template using the AI-generated prompt for Ansible Lightspeed.

By organizing these steps into a workflow, we simulate how multiple tools can collaborate to enrich a ticket or alert and prepare the remediation plan‚Äîall before a human even reviews the problem.

‚ö†Ô∏è This workflow will be automatically triggered by EDA once the `‚ùå Break Apache` job template is run. You must create this workflow before simulating the failure.

== Introducing AI with Ansible

Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) is already deployed in this lab and powered by the **Granite LLM** model. You can interact with this AI using simple curl commands or trigger it through Job Templates via Ansible Automation Platform.

RHEL AI is deployed using two Ansible Content Collections:

* `redhat.ai` (Certified)
* `infra.ai` (Validated)

These are available as part of your AAP subscription, giving your organization a quick and validated path to deploy generative AI models using automation.

=== Try It Yourself: Talk to the AI!

Before diving into the workflow, let‚Äôs see how easy it is to test this out yourself.

1. Open the **Terminal** in the lab.
2. Run the following `curl` command (replace `<TOKEN>` with your lab password):

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://rhelai.example.com:8000/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "/root/.cache/instructlab/models/granite-8b-lab-v1",
    "prompt": "What is the capital of USA?",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "temperature": 0
  }' | jq -r '.choices[0].text'
----

You can also try real-world prompts like:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST http://rhelai.example.com:8000/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
    "model": "/root/.cache/instructlab/models/granite-8b-lab-v1",
    "prompt": "systemd[1]: httpd.service: Failed with result exit-code. Suggest a fix for Apache.",
    "max_tokens": 150,
    "temperature": 0.6
  }' | jq -r .choices[0].text
----

This returns a JSON response with helpful AI suggestions. This is exactly what‚Äôs being automated in the next step via the **ü§ñ RHEL AI: Analyze Incident** job template.

== Exploring Mattermost Integration

In this lab environment, we‚Äôve included Mattermost, a lightweight, open-source chat client that serves as a central place to view error logs and AI insights as part of your AI-Ops workflow.

Think of Mattermost as a stand-in for ServiceNow in this demonstration.

[quote]
üí° In a real-world production environment, you can easily replace Mattermost with ServiceNow (or any other ITSM tool). This enables a more advanced automated workflow, where tickets are automatically created and enriched with logs and insights ‚Äî all before a human even picks up the ticket!

=== Accessing Mattermost
	1.	Navigate to the Mattermost tab in the lab landing page (or use the direct link provided).
	2.	Click on ‚ÄúView in Browser‚Äù to open the console.
	3.	Login using the credentials provided in the Mattermost section of the lab‚Äôs landing page:

[options=‚Äúheader‚Äù]
|===
| Field | Value
| Username | ansibleadmin@ansible.com
| Password | ansible123!
|===

Once logged in, click on the Town Square channel from the left-hand navigation.

image::mattermost_town_square_placeholder.png[Click on Town Square, 60%, link=‚Äúreplace_with_actual_image_later‚Äù]

=== What You‚Äôll See in Town Square

In the Town Square channel, you will begin seeing:
	‚Ä¢	üîç Error logs from the Apache HTTPD service (collected by Filebeat and forwarded via Kafka)
	‚Ä¢	üß† AI Insights generated from the logs using RHEL AI

This real-time feed mimics how production environments might use automated ticket enrichment ‚Äî by capturing logs and insights and sending them directly to a ticketing system like ServiceNow.

üí° With this integration, you are essentially watching AI and automation work together ‚Äî detecting the issue, diagnosing it, and preparing remediation guidance before anyone intervenes.

== Guide

1. Log in to the web UI for Ansible Automation Platform if you're not already logged in.

2. In the left navigation menu, click on *Automation Execution* ‚Üí *Templates*.

[start=3]
3. Click the blue *Create template* button, then select **Create workflow job template**.

[start=4]
4. Fill out the following values

[options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Value
| Name | AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generation
| Organization | Default
|===

[start=5]
5. Click the blue *Create workflow job template* button

image::create_workflow_job_template.png[create_workflow_job_template,300]

[start=7]
7. Click the blue *Add Step* button to begin adding Job Templates to the workflow.

== Workflow Steps

Each of the following steps adds a specific job template. Let‚Äôs go through them one by one.

[start=8]
8. Add the first step:

[options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Value
| Node type | Job Template
| Job Template | ‚öôÔ∏è Apache Service Status Check
| Convergence | Any
| Node alias | (You can leave this blank)
|===

[start=9]
9. Add the second step connected to the first:

[options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Value

[start=11]
11. Finally, add the last step:

‚ö†Ô∏è This job template will generate another job template using the Lightspeed AI-generated prompt. That new job template will be used in the next workflow for actual remediation.

== Trigger the Workflow

Once this workflow is saved, it will be automatically triggered by EDA when Apache fails.  
To simulate the failure and test the flow:

[start=12]
12. Run the `‚ùå Break Apache` job template. This inserts an invalid directive in Apache config and restarts the service.

image::run_break_apache.png[Run ‚ùå Break Apache Template]

13. Go to *EDA Controller* ‚Üí *Rulebook Activations* and observe that the rulebook captured the event.

image::eda_trigger_capture.png[EDA Rulebook Activation Capture]

14. Return to *Automation Controller* ‚Üí *Jobs* to verify that the workflow `AI Insights and Lightspeed prompt generation` was triggered successfully.

‚úÖ Once this completes, you‚Äôll have a brand new job template ready to run Lightspeed-based remediation using the AI-generated prompt!
