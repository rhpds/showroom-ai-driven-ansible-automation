= Section 2 - Remediation Workflow

== Objective

For this section, we will build another workflow called the **Remediation Workflow**. The goal for this workflow is to take the information we learned from Section 1 with RHEL AI and now prompt Ansible Lightspeed to automatically create an Ansible Playbook to fix the issue. By combining these two workflows, we can create an AIOps workflow capable of self-healing infrastructure.

By separating these two parts into distinct workflows, we allow for manual review of the response from RHEL AI and can take corrective action if necessary. This creates a natural stopping point in our automation workflow where we can ensure the automation is performing as expected.
