= Section 2 - Remediation Workflow


== Objective

For this section we will build another workflow called the **Remediation Workflow**.  The goal for this workflow is to take the information we learned from Section 1 from RHEL AI and now prompt Ansible Lightspeed to automatically create an Ansible Playbook to fix the issue.  By combining these two workflows we can create an AIOps workflow and create self healing infrastrucure!

By sepearting these two parts into two separate workflows, this allows us to manually review the response from RHEL AI and make correction action if necessary. This is a natural stopping point in our automation workflow where we can make sure the automation is doing what we expect it to do.
