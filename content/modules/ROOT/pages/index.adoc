== Lab Introduction

In this lab, you will build an intelligent, self-healing automation workflow using:

- 🧠 RHEL AI for understanding service issues
- ✨ Ansible Lightspeed to generate remediation playbooks
- 🔁 Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) workflows for orchestration
- 📡 Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) to listen to real-time service events
- 📦 Gitea for GitOps-style content management
- 💬 Mattermost for alerting and notifications

The goal is to showcase how **automation + AI** can be used to detect, analyze, and remediate Apache service failures **without writing any playbooks manually**.

---

== Lab Environment

Here's what is already running in your demo environment:

- A RHEL node with Apache (`httpd`) installed
- Filebeat monitoring Apache logs
- Kafka acting as the event transport
- EDA listening to Kafka and launching workflows based on defined rules
- RHEL AI to infer incident context from logs
- Ansible Lightspeed to generate a remediation playbook
- Gitea for version control
- Ansible Automation Controller to run job templates and workflows

---

== Step 1: Create Workflow 1 – `Generate Lightspeed Remediation`

This workflow is triggered by EDA when it receives an event indicating Apache failure.

Create a new **workflow job template** with the name: `Generate Lightspeed Remediation`.

Add the following job templates in this order:

=== 1. `⚙️ Apache Service Status Check`

*Purpose:*
Checks whether Apache is active and logs its status.

*What it does:*
- Runs `systemctl status httpd`
- Collects output and logs it
- Output is consumed by the next steps (RHEL AI and Mattermost)

---

=== 2. `🤖 RHEL AI: Analyze Incident`

*Purpose:*
Uses RHEL AI inference service to understand the failure message.

*What it does:*
- Sends logs from the previous step to a model served using InstructLab
- Returns a natural-language description of the error
- Suggests what kind of automation could fix it

---

=== 3. `📣 Notify via Mattermost`

*Purpose:*
Sends a human-readable incident message to a Mattermost channel.

*What it does:*
- Formats the AI response and Apache status
- Pushes it to a channel using Mattermost Webhook
- Simulates integration with a real ITSM tool like ServiceNow

---

=== 4. `⚙️ Build Ansible Lightspeed Job Template`

*Purpose:*
Creates a new job template with a survey that includes:
- A user-defined prompt field
- A pre-filled prompt from RHEL AI output

*Why this is important:*
This allows Ansible Lightspeed to generate a remediation playbook without writing code manually. The job template created here will be used in the second workflow.

---

== Step 2: Simulate the Failure (Trigger Workflow 1)

After saving Workflow 1, simulate a failure in Apache to trigger the flow.

. Launch the job template: `❌ Break Apache`
*Purpose:* Introduces a known bad directive in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` to cause Apache failure

*What happens next:*
- Filebeat detects the service issue
- Kafka forwards the event
- EDA rulebook matches and triggers `Generate Lightspeed Remediation` workflow

---

== Step 3: Create Workflow 2 – `Execute HTTPD Remediation`

This second workflow starts from the **job template created in Step 1 (Lightspeed Generator)** and finishes with a new job template that applies the fix.

Create a workflow named: `Execute HTTPD Remediation`

Add the following job templates:

=== 1. `🧠 Lightspeed Remediation Playbook Generator`

*Purpose:*
Runs the job template created in Workflow 1 to generate a playbook from the AI prompt.

*What it does:*
- Uses Lightspeed to turn a prompt into a YAML playbook
- Stores the result locally as `lightspeed-response.yml`

---

=== 2. `🧾 Commit Fix to Gitea`

*Purpose:*
Pushes the generated playbook to the Gitea Git repository.

*What it does:*
- Authenticates with Gitea
- Commits `lightspeed-response.yml`
- Makes the playbook available for automation use

---

=== 3. `📂 Sync Project: Lightspeed-Playbooks`

*Purpose:*
Syncs the `Lightspeed-Playbooks` project in AAP so the new playbook becomes available in the UI.

---

=== 4. `⚙️ Build HTTPD Remediation Template`

*Purpose:*
Creates a new job template that uses the playbook pushed in Step 2 to fix the Apache service.

*Note:*
This job template is created dynamically and **cannot be part of the workflow**, but it will now appear in the Templates list.

---

== Step 4: Execute the Final Fix

After Workflow 2 completes:

. Navigate to *Templates → Job Templates*
. Look for the new remediation job template (e.g. `✅ Execute HTTPD Remediation`)
. Launch it manually

*What it does:*
- Applies the fix to Apache configuration
- Restarts the `httpd` service
- Verifies if the issue is resolved

---

== Optional: `✅ Restore Apache`

If you want to return Apache to a good state (without fixing it via Workflow 2), you can run the `✅ Restore Apache` job template.

---

== Summary of Job Templates

Here's a recap of the job templates used in the lab:

|===
| Name | Purpose

| `❌ Break Apache` | Simulates a failure in the Apache config
| `⚙️ Apache Service Status Check` | Checks the current state of Apache
| `🤖 RHEL AI: Analyze Incident` | Uses RHEL AI to understand the error
| `📣 Notify via Mattermost` | Sends incident details to a chat system
| `⚙️ Build Ansible Lightspeed Job Template` | Creates a JT to generate playbooks
| `🧠 Lightspeed Remediation Playbook Generator` | Uses Lightspeed to generate the fix
| `🧾 Commit Fix to Gitea` | Pushes the generated playbook to Git
| `📂 Sync Project: Lightspeed-Playbooks` | Updates Controller project with latest content
| `⚙️ Build HTTPD Remediation Template` | Creates JT to apply the AI-generated fix
| `✅ Execute HTTPD Remediation` | Final fix (launched manually)
| `✅ Restore Apache` | Restores Apache to a known-good config

== Access & Credentials

You're already logged into the environment as `{ssh_user}`. No manual setup is needed.

All lab content is preconfigured and ready to run.

---

== What's Next?

This lab gives you a starting point for building self-healing automation powered by AI. To extend:

- Replace Mattermost with ServiceNow or another ticketing system
- Add approval steps before applying fixes
- Support more services (e.g., MySQL, SSH, DNS)
- Visualize logs using Kibana or Grafana

---

== Congratulations 🎉

You’ve just built an **AI-powered closed-loop remediation system** using:

- 📡 Real-time event capture with EDA
- 🧠 AI error understanding with RHEL AI
- ✨ AI-generated fixes with Ansible Lightspeed
- 📦 Git-backed version control
- 🔁 AAP workflows to tie it all together

This is the future of intelligent automation. 🚀
